# ModelViewController-challenge14

Hi, I worked a long time on this and just about beat my head in. I got a lot of it complete: the signin/out, new posts, edit/delete (manage) posts. 

Unfortunately, I do not have the time to finish the comment feature since I have to catch up! Better than a 0.

Did learn a lot though!
